### Find the Duplicate Number

#### Problem Description

You are given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers. Each integer in `nums` is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

Every integer appears exactly once, except for one integer which appears two or more times. Return the integer that appears more than once.

**_Example 1:_**
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,2,2]
**Output:** 2

**_Example 2:_**
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
**Output:** 4

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using O(1) extra space?

**_Constraints:_**

- `1 <= n <= 10000`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
