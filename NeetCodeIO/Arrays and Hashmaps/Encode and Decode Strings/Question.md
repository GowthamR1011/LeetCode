### Encode and Decode Strings

#### Problem Description

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

**_Example 1:_**
**Input:** ["neet","code","love","you"]
**Output:** ["neet","code","love","you"]

**_Example 2:_**
**Input:** ["we","say",":","yes"]
**Output:** ["we","say",":","yes"]

**_Constraints:_**

- `0 <= strs.length < 100`
- `0 <= strs[i].length < 200`
- `strs[i]` contains only UTF-8 characters.
