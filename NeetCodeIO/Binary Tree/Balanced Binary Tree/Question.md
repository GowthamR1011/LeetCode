### Balanced Binary Tree

#### Problem Description

Given a binary tree, return `true` if it is height-balanced and `false` otherwise.

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

**_Example 1:_**
**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]
**Output:** true

**_Example 2:_**
**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,null,5]
**Output:** false

**_Example 3:_**
**Input:** root = []
**Output:** true

**_Constraints:_**

- `The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
