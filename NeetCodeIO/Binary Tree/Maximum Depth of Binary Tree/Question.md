### Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

#### Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its depth.

The depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**_Example 1:_**
**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]
**Output:** 3

**_Example 2:_**
**Input:** root = []
**Output:** 0

**_Constraints:_**

- `0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
