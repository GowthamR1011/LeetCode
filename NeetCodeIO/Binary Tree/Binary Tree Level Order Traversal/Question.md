### Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

#### Problem Description

Given a binary tree `root`, return the level order traversal of it as a nested list, where each sublist contains the values of nodes at a particular level in the tree, from left to right.

**_Example 1:_**
**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
**Output:** [[1],[2,3],[4,5,6,7]]

**_Example 2:_**
**Input:** root = [1]
**Output:** [[1]]

**_Example 3:_**
**Input:** root = []
**Output:** []

**_Constraints:_**

- `0 <= The number of nodes in both trees <= 1000.`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
