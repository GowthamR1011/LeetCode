### Trapping Rain Water

#### Problem Description

You are given an array non-negative integers `height` which represent an elevation map. Each value `height[i]` represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

**_Example 1:_**
**Input:** height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]
**Output:** 9

**_Constraints:_**

- `1 <= height.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 1000`
