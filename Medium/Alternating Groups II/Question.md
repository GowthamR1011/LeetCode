### 3208. Alternating Groups II

#### Problem Description

There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers `colors` and an integer `k`. The color of tile `i` is represented by `colors[i]`:
- `colors[i] == 0` means that tile `i` is red.
- `colors[i] == 1` means that tile `i` is blue.

An alternating group is every `k` contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its left and right tiles).

Return the number of alternating groups.

**Note** that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.
