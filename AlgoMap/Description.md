### Playlist Description 

On my journey to learn and practice Algorithms, I found a good resource that contains a structred playlist of leetcode questions.

The resource has multiple playlist split up various topics. It can be found on this link `https://algomap.io/`.

This folder of the repository will follow the same section headings. All the solutions are my own solutions to every problem.
