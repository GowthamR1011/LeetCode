# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in Python. The problems cover various difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) and touch upon a variety of fundamental and advanced topics. Will add more solutions as I keep working on my LeetCode Journey. All the solutions are uploaded in this repository only after they pass all the Leetcode testcases of the quesiton. 

#### Repository Structure

At the root there are 3 folders, Easy, Medium and Hard. These serve the purpose of classifying the questions based on their difficulty as listed by LeetCode. 

In each directory, the name of the question is kept as the folder name that contains the respective solutions. 


#### Each solution includes:

- **Problem description** (as per LeetCode) in a MarkDown File. 
- **Python code**: My Python 3 solution in the file `solution.py`
<!-- - **C++ Code**: My C++ solution in the file `solution.cpp` -->


##  Motivation

The primary goal of this repository is to motivate myself and other developers in their leetcode journey: 

Feel free to explore the solutions, suggest improvements, or contribute by solving additional problems!
